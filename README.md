# DIKI1002-Working-with-Text-in-Python
 
## Course description
The course is based on weekly teaching materials and exercises as well as an exam at the end of the course. 

The course is a modified version of the MOOC by Tuomo Hiippala (Uni Helsinki). Some instructions may mention the MOOC - nevermind those.

## Interaction
The course discussion forum (link above under "Discussions" is the main platform for interacting with other students. There you can ask questions, and get help to the exercises. Participating in the discussions in rewarded in the course evaluation. By participating actively (either asking or answering), you can get 3 extra points / week. 

Additionally, I keep weekly office hours on Fridays on Zoom (link below). This is for solving questions that are not solved in the discussion forum, or if you have other things you would want to discuss with me.

### Passing the course

The course consists of the weekly exercises, discussion on the discussion forum, and the exam (also done on CSC Notebooks). To do the exam, you need to have submitted all the weekly exercises. 

Please note that the deadline for submitting the exercises is on Mondays at 23.59, excluding the first week, when the dl is on Wednesday to leave sufficient time to do the exercises.
You need to get at least 30% of the points to get to the next exercise. Submitting the exercises late is possible until Wednesday, but you can only get 75% of the points if the submission is late.

The evaluation is based on the exam with extra points from participating actively in the forum discussions.

### Course materials

The course materials are at https://applied-language-technology.mooc.fi/html/index.html. 
Parts I and II belong to this course, part III to the next course, ”Natural Language Processing for Linguists” (available in the fourth period).

### Course environment

The course happens on the platform CSC Notebooks, available at https://notebooks.rahtiapp.fi/. 

To get to the** course environment,** please do the following steps:
1) Log in to the notebooks by signing in using your HAKA (that is UTU) -credentials
2) Find the correct course environment by writing the code dik-l31w8jxw to ”Join workspace”. After these two steps, you should see the course "DIKI1002/1003 Course Environment" in your "My workspaces".
4) Click on the starting icon on the right side of the course name box. This starts a session on the course server.
5) Once you have started a session, the course materials are listed under the directory "notebooks" on the left side of the screen.

Detailed instructions on how to use Notebooks can be found here: https://applied-language-technology.mooc.fi/html/getting_started.html 

**The exercises** come to the Notebooks environment using the platform Test My Code. First, you need to create credentials to TMC at https://tmc.mooc.fi/.

Detailed instructions on how to use TMC can be found here: https://applied-language-technology.mooc.fi/html/tmc.html. Please read those.

A short video on how to log into CSC Notebooks and use TMC can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPuDcmd7ds1O2N3gknQaLkbgSFh-Agx9/view?usp=sharing (Finnnish)

The steps to copy the exercises are: 
1) Type the command tmc login on the terminal command line and press enter
2) Give your username and password (the password you type does not show, but it is still registered)
3) If the login is successful, TMC will prompt you to select an organization. Please select "ty-utu-working-with-text"-
4) Download the exercises by typing tmc download (and enter)
5) Now, the exercise notebooks should show in the menu on left.
   
Once you have done the exercise of the week, you can test how many points you get, and when happy with the result, submit your exercise. The testing is done with the command tmc test, and submission with tmc submit.
N.B.! the command tmc test evaluates your exercises locally, for you. Only the command tmc submit submits them to the course platform, where I can see them. Remember to submit!

### Course schedule
The correct solutions are shown here on Github after the deadline, on Thursday. The exercises cover seven weeks, and the exam the week eight.

Remember that 
1) You need to have selected the course ty-utu-working-with-text on TMC (a frequent error is to submit the exercises to the MOOC)
2) The exercises are returned using the tmc submit command. You can first check your grade using tmc test, and once you are happy with your grade, you should submit your final version using tmc submit (see above for further info).
3) You need to submit the exercises on time.
