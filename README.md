# DIKI1002-Working-with-Text-in-Python
 
## Course description
The course consists of teaching materials, weekly exercises and exam. Additionally, you can get extra points by participating actively in the discussions on the course discussion forum. The link to the discussion forum is above under "Discussions". You can get 3 points / week, in total 24 points. 

The course is based on the MOOC by Tuomo Hiippala (Uni Helsinki). Some instructions may mention the MOOC - nevermind those.

### Course materials

The course materials are at https://applied-language-technology.mooc.fi/html/index.html. 
Parts I and II belong to this course, part III to the next course, ”Natural Language Processing for Linguists” (available in the fourth period).

### Course environment

The course happens on the platform CSC Notebooks, available at https://notebooks.rahtiapp.fi/. 

To get to the** course environment,** please do the following steps:
1) Enroll to the course by signing in using your HAKA (that is UTU) -credentials
2) Write the code dik-vozfxsbq to ”Join workspace”. After these two steps, you should see the course in your "My workspaces".
3) Click on the starting icon on the right side of the course name box. This starts a session on the course server.
4) Once you have started a session, the course materials are listed under the directory "notebooks" on the left side of the screen.

Detailed instructions on how to use Notebooks can be found here: https://applied-language-technology.mooc.fi/html/getting_started.html 

**The exercises** come to the Notebooks environment using the platform Test My Code. First, you need to create credentials to TMC at https://tmc.mooc.fi/.

Detailed instructions on how to use TMC can be found here: https://applied-language-technology.mooc.fi/html/tmc.html. Please read those.

A short video on how to log into CSC Notebooks and use TMC can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPuDcmd7ds1O2N3gknQaLkbgSFh-Agx9/view?usp=sharing (Finnnish)

The steps to copy the exercises are: 
1) Type the command tmc login on the terminal command line and press enter
2) Give your username and password (the password you type does not show, but it is still registered)
3) If the login is successful, TMC will prompt you to select an organization. Please select "ty-utu-working-with-text"-
4) Download the exercises by typing tmc download (and enter)
5) Now, the exercise notebooks should show in the menu on left.
   
Once you have done the exercise of the week, you can test how many points you get, and when happy with the result, submit your exercise. The testing is done with the command tmc test, and submission with tmc submit.
N.B.! the command tmc test evaluates your exercises locally, for you. Only the command tmc submit submits them to the course platform, where I can see them. Remember to submit!

### Passing the course

The course consists of the weekly exercises, discussion on the discussion forum, and the exam (also done on CSC Notebooks). 

### Course schedule

The deadline for the weekly exercises is on Mondays at 23.59, excluding the first week, when the dl is on Wednesday to leave sufficient time to do the exercises. The exercises are returned using the tmc submit command.

You need to get at least 30% of the points to get to the next exercise. Submitting the exercises late is possible until Wednesday, but you can only get 75% of the points if the submission is late.

The correct solutions are shown here on Github after the deadline, on Thursday. The exercises cover seven weeks, and the exam the week eight.

Additionally, I keep office hours every Friday at 12.15-13.00 on Zoom: https://utu.zoom.us/j/63443700986
This is for asking further questions on the exercises, if the discussion forum is not sufficient.

You can first check your grade using tmc test, and once you are happy with your grade, you can submit your final version using tmc submit (see above for further info).
